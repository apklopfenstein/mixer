<!--MAIN ISSUES-->

MAIN ISSUES
-make sure it works on heroku
-seed file
-responsiveness (especially on landing page)
-card design cleanup
-make a readme
-in Song.js lines 32-35 the s3 key causes error and songs page to not load(but it works without it...)

tasks and features if we get to them:
-refactoringgg
-was thinking we could repurpose the 'details' button on songs page to be 'notepad', and it brings up a text box that can be edited, with 'save changes' and 'cancel' at bottom of modal. would go in the comments route of the db that we didn't get to



<!-- homepage -->


<!-- projects page -->
-clean up projects card



('add member' button functionality and add to db   
 form    
 form handler    
 add association to db  
redirect to empty projects page)

 (delete project button    
 functionality    
 delete from db)



 <!-- project-select page (songs page) -->

-make songs clickable, bring up modal?

  (make song card editable:
  edit comments, title, add mp3)

<!-- newsong page -->
